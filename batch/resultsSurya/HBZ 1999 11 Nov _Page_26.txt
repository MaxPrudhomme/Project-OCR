Whether you're toasting 2000 at Jeffery Jah's
beach bash in Bali or at Ingrid Casares’ and Sean 
“Puffy” Combs’ South Beach parties, there’s never
been a more crucial time to pack carefully, and
with major pizzazz: Travel essentials take on a
glitzy twist when those three historic zeros are
staring up from your PalmPilot screen. From
Prada's slick periwinkle patent carryall to Tomas
HOTOGRAPH, 
Maier's crystal-spotted bikini to Manolo Blahnik's
sky-high turquoise beaded stilettos, pick the
pieces that will pop when the Waterford Crystal
ball drops in Times Square.
