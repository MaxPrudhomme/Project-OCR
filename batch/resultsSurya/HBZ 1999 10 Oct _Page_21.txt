onna Karan, Kate Cap-
shaw and Andrew Tilberis
recently cohosted Super
Saturday2, in Water Mill,
NY, an afternoon of bar-
gain designer shopping, a 
kids carnival, dancing and fireworks to ben- 
efit the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund. Ve-
ra Wang, Michael Kors and Randolph Duke 
helped outfit lucky guests, while the little 
afternoon
ones had their faces painted, ate cotton 
candy and played on the moon walk. We’re
 sure Liz would have loved it.
