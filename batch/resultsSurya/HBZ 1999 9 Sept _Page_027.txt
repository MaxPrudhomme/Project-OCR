 Even the most minimalist women are 
wearing jewelry these days, and the
more personal the piece, the better.
Until recently, the only shimmer
 you'd find on Martin designer Anne 
 Johnston was her diamond solitaire 
engagement ring. Now she’s rarely
without her favorite M+J Savitt lapis
cross, a present from a friend, or her 
triple-strand beaded necklace, a gift
from her mother-in-law, Joan. Down-
town PR wiz Risa Scobie never takes 
off her gold RISA necklace (a gift from 
her two best friends) or her Alex
Streeter silver winged-heart ring (her
mother wore it in the '70s). Writer
Miranda Darling lives in her big gold
hoops and religious medallions, and
designer Soledad Twombly, who col-
lects pieces from all over the world,
loves to wear her 1920s faceted
coral necklace from Sardinia, Italy.
Makeup artist Tina Bech has a
weakness for gold Indian pieces de-
signed by her friend Mads Kornerup
at Shamballa, in NYC. And, of
love th
course, there are the jewelry design-
ers themselves: Nikki Butler (of Nikki
Risa Scobie
BUYLINE
B.) shows off a few of her own deli-
cately beaded creations, while
Michelle Quan and Robin Renzi of
Me & Ro make piling it all on look
easy. Viva la jewelry!
