ven though her name suggests otherwise,
Galaxy Craze isn't a hippie. In fact, fall hap-
pens to be her favorite season, because the
Barnard graduate loves to wear big sweaters,
plaid skirts, woolly tights and Mary Janes. “I
have dorky taste!” she confesses, holding up
her cotton tote printed with farm animals.
Twenty-eight-year-old Craze, who is now working on her sec-
ond novel (her first, By the Shore, was published last May), has
specific needs when it comes to shoes. Her dream pair? “They’d
have a one-and-a-half-inch heel—but not a big fat one—with a
Mary Jane front, but not too girlish or chunky,” she says. Until
she finds them, she settles for her plain brown leather sandals
from England. Though she’s no flower child, Craze admits she’s
somewhat inspired by her parents’ life in London in the ’60s. “My
father owned Sweeney's & Todd's hair salon on King's Road,"
she says. There, he cut the manes of Mick Jagger, Keith
Richards and Jimi Hendrix. Craze's mother saved a lot of her
clothes from those days and has passed them on to her daugh-
ter. “I really like the Jean Muir stuff. It’s beautiful and doesn’t
scream ‘I’m from the ’60s,” she says. Craze mixes these pieces
with classics by Anna Sui, Isaac Mizrahi and Marc Jacobs. “I’ll
only buy something expensive if I can wear it for at least five
years," she states. When she's writing,
Craze wants to be comfortable. “I like to
feel cozy," she says and pulls out her uni-
form-a pair of sweats, a J.Crew thermal
and a vintage cashmere cardigan. She al-
so loves jewelry by Me & Ro: “I like to
know that what I’m wearing is made by
nice people-and I really like them.”
