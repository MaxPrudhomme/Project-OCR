o, who takes longer to get ready to go
out? Kirsty Hume and Donovan Leitch 
are asked, and the answer is a polite
pause. “Kirsty takes longer,” Donovan fi-
nally admits, adding that she's shortened 
her prep time. You won't hear accusa-
tions of mirror- or expensive-shampoo-hogging
here. After two years of marriage, they're still in the
lovebird phase. They seem quite happy to be hiding 
out in their little (but very charming) house in the
Woodstock, NY, forest, escaping the demands of
their Manhattan existence as social-circuit super-
model and aspiring rock star (Donovan, son of singer
Donovan, is front man for the band Nancy Boy).
While they've found the perfect place for downtime
between all the gigs, fashion shows and photo
shoots, the earthy surroundings make their sexy,
almost-all-natural glam stand out even more. Their
beauty secrets are a brilliant mix of hip and healthy.
