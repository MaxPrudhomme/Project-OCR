Ménage à Trois
This season’s Runway Overachiever Award 
goes to makeup artist Linda Cantello, who 
went above and beyond the call of duty to 
create three stand-alone looks at the fall Yves
Saint Laurent show: a completely nude face, a 
strong lip with bare eyes, and smoky bedroom 
lids with a naked mouth. “It was Alber Elbaz’s
first show for YSL," explains Cantello, "so I
wanted to do something special to celebrate.”
On Noot's lips, Cantello dabbed
YSL Rouge Pur No.11, a bright
matte red. "The French know how
to do red lipstick right."
