mystery. “I’m just chilling right now,” he says, announcing his single
status. Although he quickly denies rumors linking him to Chloé de-
signer Stella McCartney, there’s still a nagging urge to know just

 up at the mosaic ceiling of blue mirrored tiles.
 Kravitz has always been a patron of design. He has stayed up all 
night to scour the Paris flea market for art nouveau pieces, and
he's purchased furniture in Barcelona, where one of his favorite ar-
chitects, the late Antoni Gaudi, lived and worked. He loves Frank
Lloyd Wright and Japanese minimalism. But there was a time
nearly 15 years ago when his interior-design endeavors turned
dangerous. He attempted to emulate the sleek look of Melrose Av-
enue’s exclusive store Maxfield in his own downtown Los Angeles
loft. “I wanted polished concrete floors and, like an idiot, I put
chicken wire down on the wood floor and poured cement on it,”
he recalls. “The floor could have collapsed from the weight, but I
didn’t give a shit. I risked death, eager to have my look.”
 Kravitz can now afford the luxury of hiring professionals. Czysz,
the principal at Architropolis (a design firm in Portland, OR), first met
Kravitz when those do-it-yourself concrete floors began to disas-
trously crack, and Kravitz has worked with him ever since. Czysz is
currently designing a spiritual retreat, Eleutheria, on Kravitz's proper-
ty on the Bahamian island of Eleuthera, and he also refurbished
Kravitz’s nearly 200-year-old shotgun house in New Orleans’ French
Quarter. There, the crucifixes, plush velvets, dramatic chandeliers,
big beautiful sofas and exposed brick contrast with the discipline of
Miami. “Miami is my fresh, of-the-moment vibe,” says Kravitz. “It’s
modern and clean. This house is a place where I can think, where I
can write and record music.” (There is a studio next to the ➤530
