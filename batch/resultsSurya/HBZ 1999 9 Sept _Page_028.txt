q asks, When and v
hen the Dow Jones Industrial Av-
erage broke 10,000 and then
11,000 recently, I thought to my-
self, so what if my mutual funds
aren’t necessarily going up. Even
if they were, I don't think that I’d
hyperventilate over this financial barometer the way so
many journalists, brokers and guys I know do.
All this obsessing over the stock market has a par-
ticularly male cast to it. Is there a female equivalent? I
obsess over other numbers: whether my $300 round-
toe Guccis will stay in style for a whole season, how
many shrink visits until I'm sane ($6000 worth, I fig-
ure). But the number that resonates the most was the
first time I spent $1000 on a single item of clothing-
breaking through the four-figure barrier for a coat that
l couldn’t afford at half the price, and to be honest,
didn’t need, but had to have for my own reasons.
I checked with a few friends and found they have
similar memories, and could, in fact, tell me exactly
what the purchase was, when it was and even why
they really had to have it.
 For background on the Fashion $1000, I telephoned 
designer Bill Blass, who said he couldn’t remember
when women started paying $1000 for something to
wear. “But I will tell you,” he said in his wrinkly patri-
cian voice, “a woman will pay just about any amount if
she feels that she must have something.”
