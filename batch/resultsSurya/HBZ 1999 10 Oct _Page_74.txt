Bill Bradley is running for president, but if 
there were a campaign-management test
on how not to do it, he would earn a per-
fect score. In our homogenized, pasteur-
ized, wholly packaged world, the sartori-
ally challenged former Democratic sena-
tor is refusing to mold his image. Long 
ago dubbed Senator Sominex by fellow
politicians for his soporific pacing and
monotone delivery, the Gary Cooper of
the Senate cheerfully acknowledges hav-
ing flunked multiple attempts at speech 
coaching. His supporters, longtime
friends and even his wife of 25 years, 
Ernestine, admit that he lacks charisma.
 And when his good friend Robert Redford 
was making his 1972 film The Candidate
and cast Bradley in a cameo, he had to
cut him out because, says Redford, “He
was dreadful. He was cast as a truck dri-
ver, and he couldn’t even pull that off. But
it's not important. Bill will never be an ac-
tor. He doesn’t need to work hard at en-
tertaining or being charismatic. He's very
solid in everything else he does.”
For good or for ill, Bradley is flying in the
face of conventional wisdom on how to be
elected as this country’s next chief execu-
tive. And yet, to the surprise of everyone,
possibly even himself, he might have a 
winning strategy. The dark-horse candidate
