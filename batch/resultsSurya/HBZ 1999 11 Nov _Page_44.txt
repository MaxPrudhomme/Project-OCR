hloë Sevigny has a pen-
chant for haunting and
risky roles, starring in
such offbeat movies as
Kids, Trees Lounge and
Gummo. This month,
Sevigny adds another somber part to
her résumé with Boys Don’t Cry. The
film tells the harrowing, true story of
Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), the
Nebraska teen whose troubled past
and struggle with her sexual identity
lead her to pass herself off as a boy.
Sevigny plays Brandon's girlfriend,
Lana, a small-town factory worker who
is perfectly aware of the limitations of
her surroundings. The 24-year-old
actress handled the complex role with
a knowing, distant sadness and finds
the movie difficult to talk about. “It was
really hard to make,” she says quietly.
Sevigny also appears in Julien Don-
key-Boy, a film about schizophrenia
by her boyfriend Harmony Korine,
which was directed and shot using
complete improvisation. “I can’t wait 
for Julien Donkey-Boy," Sevigny says,
in an uncharacteristic gush. “That's
the way to make movies.” And next
o o
year, she stars in American Psycho,
as the prim and proper secretary of a
dapper serial killer, played by Christian
Bale. Of her predilection for the dark-
est of films, Sevigny laughs and says,
“I would like to do a comedy, so my
mother will enjoy it.”     —Sara Switzer
