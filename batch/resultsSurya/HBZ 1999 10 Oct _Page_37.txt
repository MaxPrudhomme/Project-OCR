are high. How to pre-
vent disaster? Consul-
tation is everything,
and it should be done before you even change in-
 to your robe (read: before you become a generic 
client). And input shouldn’t stop there; if you don’t
like some aspect of the cut while it's happening,
let your stylist know. Although speaking up isn’t
as easy as it sounds, hair can be fixed and ad-
justed. “Good stylists should also be able to read 
a client’s body language once the cut gets start-
ed,” explains Alain Pinon of Salon AKS in New
York City, who teaches his stylists to look for
signs that a client might be starting to freak-
squeezing her hands together, fidgeting in the
chair, touching her hair. Here, advice from Pinon

for elements of a particular style-length, tex-
ture, bangs. Once a stylist figures out what you
want, then he can discuss specifically what will
and won’t look great.” Just saying “no, impos-
sible,” to a client’s photo is taking the easy way
out, adds Pinon, who usually finds a way to
