iorgio Armani loves his rock &
Drena De Niro
roll. Which is why he recently
threw a rockin’ party in
Hollywood for his friend, guitar 
legend Eric Clapton, to preview 
40 of the 100 guitars Clapton 
was auctioning at Christie’s the following
week. (The auction rang in $5 million plus—all
to benefit a rehab center Clapton founded in
Antigua.) Armani hadn’t visited Los Angeles in
Glenn
five years, and it was obvious from the star-
Close
studded crush that he was sorely missed.
