FUR OUT
FUR DOESN'T MEAN A CLASSIC THREE-QUARTER LENGTH MINK THESE DAYS. IN
FACT, THIS FALL IT'S MATERIAL. FOR SOME OF THE EDGIEST TRENDS. WHAT'S CHIC?
ANYTHING A LITTLE ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES AND BARE SHAPES THAT REVEAL A

OPPOSITE PAGE: FUR COAT, ABOUT $4790, GUCCI. AT SELECT GUCCI STORES.
SUNGLASSES, PERSOL BY LUXOTTICA. BRIGHT-FUTURE FRAGRANCE: GUCCI RUSH.
