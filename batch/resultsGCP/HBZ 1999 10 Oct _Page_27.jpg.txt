My two favorite shopping areas in
Tokyo are Aoyama and Daikanyama. Both
districts have a distinct feel and charac-
ter. For me, Cabane de Zucca (4-21-29
Minami Aoyama, Minato-Ku, Tokyo; 03-
3470-7488) and Tsumori Chisato (4-21-
25 Minami Aoyama, Minato-ku, Tokyo;
03-3423-5170) are excellent examples of
design and practicality. These two de-
signers manage to maintain an innovative
approach to clothes, while still making
them very wearable. At Cabane de Zuc-
ca, the feeling was industrial femininity
with lots of color. The store's concept is
like that of a pharmacy, a place you can
buy a remedy (shirt, shoes and so on) to
make you feel better. At Tsumori Chisato
the concept for fall '99 was space and
craft. The window displayed a floating
electric train, in a figure-eight infinity de-
sign. Here, the clothing had a futuristic
yet comfortable feeling, such as ponchos
or skirts with blanket trim.
Two stores not to be missed in Aoyama
are Comme des Garçons (5-2-1, Minami
Aoyama, Minato-ku, Tokyo; 03-3406-
3951) and Junya Watanabe (Aoyama
Two 5-11-2, Minami Aoyama, Minato-ku,
Tokyo; 03-3498-1400). When I entered
the world of Comme, the heavy satura-
tion of color gave the collection a ro-
mantic and slightly comical feel. There
were Moroccan and fairy-tale-like influ-
ences. From its advertising to the archi-
tecture, the store ties together these
concepts. Junya Watanabe also focused
on color in her Hawaiian collection,
which included shockingly bright Hawai-
ian shirts, displayed against a sun-yellow
wall to intensify the effect.
In Daikanyama, you'll find shops such
as A.P.C., Abahouse, Aqua Girl and
Okura. Okura welcomes shoppers with
its very serene, Zen-like shoji doors. In-
side, the clothes (mostly made of dyed
natural indigo) hang from bamboo cloth-
ing racks. Downstairs is a cafe, which
often has specialties like blueberry juice
and Jamaican curry.
In Tokyo I met Patrick Ryan, who,
along with Yoshida Mami, designs Yab-
Yum, a line featured at Okura. A Yab-
Yum shop is slated to open in Aoyama
soon. The clothes have an Arts and
Crafts feel with a Shaker influence.
Miniature shearling earmuffs with a strap
connecting the two under the chin were
one example of the whimsical designs.
They were earthy and Spock-like.
In Tokyo, the Arts and Crafts move-
ment includes the home as well. An
amazing shop called Tokyu Hands (a
"creative life store") sells different kinds
of materials for do-it-yourself projects.
There are more than 20 levels, and each
has a different theme. The vibe is similar
to that of a home improvement channel,
with videos playing in the background
of people doing things like stringing
beads and making birdhouses. Tokyu
Hands also sells many traditional and
practical items such as old-style canvas
bags and traditional Japanese shoes. The
strangest item I noticed was Plantone, a
ball that sings to your plants. Singing is
supposed to keep the plant happy and
encourage its growth.
While in Japan, I love to check out the
latest technological gadgets. I found
some great toys this time, like a dispos-
able sepia camera, a "pretty face" dis-
posable camera (for that retouched ap-
peal) and Seiko global-locator watches,
which digitally tell you the time in any
city (soon to be available at my NYC
shop). In cafes, people were E-mailing
each other on portable devices hooked
up to their cell phones. Some of the
large electronic companies are hiring
women designers to design gadgets
from a feminine perspective.
Who knows what I'll find next time.
