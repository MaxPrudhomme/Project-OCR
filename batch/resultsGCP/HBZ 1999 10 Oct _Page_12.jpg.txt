civilian detachment (bowling?) helped Pfeiffer reconsider fame's
burden. “He's always been amazingly patient with the sordid na-
ture of being a celebrity," she says. "Sometimes you can be with
someone who kind of resents you a little bit. David was never,
ever like that." I take this as a not-so-subtle reference to her three-
year relationship with actor Fisher Stevens, but she won't bite.
What does Pfeiffer think of Kelley's turn at the rumor mill? "It does
sort of liberate me a little," she admits, but don't think she's dis-
pensing pointers. "He doesn't really need advice from me. If any-
thing, I could take a few tips from him."
In the encyclopedia of success, there are few entries as formi-
dable as Power Couple, and few power couples fiercer than
Pfeiffer and Kelley. At least until this past summer, when Kelley got
a little dirt under his Midas fingernails: Lake Placid, his big-screen
script about a giant crocodile that terrorizes Bridget Fonda, came
up luggage at the megaplex. Pfeiffer's been through this disap-
pointing game herself, most conspicuously in Dangerous Minds,
One Fine Day and The Deep End of the Ocean, all produced by
her production company, Via Rosa. One Fine Day, with George
Clooney, was expected, in particular, to be huge. The film wound
up grossing a not-especially-humongous $46 million.
"One Fine Day was the first time I allowed myself to get
caught up in numbers and expectations," Pfeiffer says. "I
don't usually do that. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to
drop." She gets up and pours a cup of tea. "When that hap-
pened, it was such a shock. I learned I was right not to buy
UNRINS
into hype. But as a producer, it's hard to detach."
Which is precisely why she has detached from producing, forev-
er. "I feel more peaceful with acting; that's where I get my reward,"
she says. But now, after What Lies Beneath, she will give acting a
(brief) rest as well. "I'm not going into hiding like Greta Garbo," she
insists. "Besides, I can't-my husband's famous, what am I gonna
do?" Instead, she'll spend a little time making sure her family
grows up right. "People have this notion that Hollywood is sort of
wild and crazy and amoral, but it's tame compared to what I see
going on in some of the neighborhoods I grew up in."
In Kurt Andersen's novel, Turn of The Century, the main charac-
ter (a television producer not unlike Kelley) calls Michelle Pfeiffer
his "fantasy wife," which strikes me as a pretty fair assessment of
how the average American male appraises her. ("Because she is
tastefully gorgeous rather than bimbo pretty," Andersen tells me.
"She seems intelligent, but she also played Catwoman.") But un-
like some other big-screen icons, women worship her, too. And
therein lies her greatness. At a screening of The Story of Us, a few
days after we part, I overhear two hardened New York media
harpies gulp midsentence when Pfeiffer first appears.
"She's gorgeous," one says.
"It's unbelievable," says the other.
Even Bruce Willis was impressed. "I was truly excited to work
with her," he says. "When you talk about the great screen god-
desses of all time, you gotta talk about Michelle Pfeiffer. And, you
know what? She turned out to be really cool."
