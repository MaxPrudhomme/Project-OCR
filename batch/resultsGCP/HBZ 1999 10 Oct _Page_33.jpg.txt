A
t the recent Valentino couture
show, makeup artist Tom
Pecheux painted lips with a
fierce but surprisingly wear-
able-deep-blue violet. Eyes
were left bare (by couture stan-
dards), accented with just three fake lashes
placed at the corners. Purple-haze your lips
at home by layering Lancôme Palette Lèvres
lip gloss in Les Incertains Violette over
Lancôme Rouge Absolu Hydrating Long
Lasting LipColour in Violette. Skip the mas-
cara in favor of a few falsies: Try Lancôme
Kit Faux-Cils False Eyelash Kit. -Leah Karp
