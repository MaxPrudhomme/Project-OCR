Store owner Steven Alan checks out what's news in Japan's
ever-evolving shopping scene from Hawaiian shirts to
Comme des Garçons to gadgets that sing to your plants.
carries a lot of the same designers plus
some items we buy in Japan.
At Under Cover (one of a chain of stores),
located in the same building as my Aoyama
shop, the direction is extremely conceptual.
Being undercover means these stores are
usually located above or below other
stores. The designer behind this line, Jun
Takahashi, is one of the more successful
new Japanese designers, following in the
footsteps of established Japanese concep-
tual designers like Junya Watanabe and
Yohji Yamamoto. Takahashi's designs can
be altered, so that you can unzip the back
of a shirt, the sleeves or a neck, for exam-
ple, to change the fabrics and colors. He
has a cult following, and his old pieces of-
ten cost more than his new ones.
've been traveling to Japan for the
last 10 years, and every time I visit
I'm amazed at what's going on in
fashion. This time around it was
the Hawaiian look. At first it
seemed isolated. But then I no-
ticed several (maybe even hundreds) of
young, tanned girls wearing blue contact
lenses and sporting platform shoes. They
reminded me a little of Fembots. There are
entire stores devoted to these customers.
What else was big? Belgian and Dutch
conceptual design was everywhere, as
were minimalist and highly ornate influ-
ences, which resonated on the Tokyo
streets of Aoyama and Daikanyama. The
Arts and Crafts style was also popular
with designers such as Yab-Yum and
Okura. But Japan is still where the old and
the new coexist. Riding back on the train
from Osaka, I saw two girls dressed in ki-
monos talking on their cell phones and
drinking iced coffee from a can. Topic of
conversation: snowboarding.
At my own store in the Aoyama shopping
district of Tokyo, there was a display case
full of photographs of my New York shop
and staff created by the manager in an ef-
fort to tie the stores together. This store is
larger than the shop on Wooster Street, but
we try to make it feel similarly intimate. It
One place you can find his used clothing,
along with that of many other designers, is
in Osaka at the Comfort shop. (Which only
takes three hours from Tokyo to travel to on
the super high-speed train Shinkansen!) An
adorable woman, Kogure, manages the
four Comfort consignment shops in Osaka.
She was dressed head to toe in Comme
des Garçons and gave me a tour of an
amazing stock of designers, including
Watanabe, Yamamoto and Comme des
Garçons. The shop has been around for 10
years and has a loyal following.
