EVENING
NEWS
As the clock ticks down to the party of the century
and fall's hectic social pace fills date books from
Hong Kong to Palm Springs, unforgettable
evening clothes are the order of the day. With
RSVPs flying through the wires, thoughts
inevitably turn to the real belles of the ball: the
clothes, of course. Deciding which crystal-
beaded bodices and billowing organza skirts in
which to toast the fin de siècle will surely make
for some of the most momentous shopping since
the weeks before Truman Capote's 1966 fabled
Black and White Ball. In the wake of fall's
nonstop frolicking, it's conceivable that by the
end of the next three months there won't be a
woman left in America without a jewel-encrusted
Fendi baguette or a dramatic taffeta skirt
hanging in her closet. So before the days get too
short, scan Bazaar's roster of after-dark options,
from the unparalleled craftsmanship and timeless
elegance of the haute couture to the graphic punch
of sleek midnight black. And above all, have a ball!
