Jewel Case
For another dose of drool-
worthy luxury, check out the
Cartier exhibit at Chicago's Field
Museum. The show, "Cartier:
1900-1939," which runs from
October 2 through January 16, is
full of the amazing jewelry,
clocks and accoutrements
created under Louis Cartier's
reign. Our favorite piece is
socialite Daisy Fellowes'
necklace (shown here). Even
the Queen of England doesn't
own jewelry like this.

Mouna Ayoub could be
the most serious shopaholic
alive, and we're not talking
about someone with a Jil
Sander obsession. Ayoub
shops couture, and lots of
it. Now 120 of her favorite
pieces (chosen from more
than 1000) are on display
at the Musée de la
Mode in Marseilles, France,
through November 28.
How much fun would it
be to play in her closet?

SILVER POLISH
Chanel is adding something slightly
unorthodox to its classic gold-chains-and-
pearls jewelry line: Sleek sterling-silver
bracelets, necklaces, rings and earrings.
Available only at Chanel boutiques, the
simple designs retail from $130 to
$2100. Coco probably never wore silver,
but we're sure she would have approved.
