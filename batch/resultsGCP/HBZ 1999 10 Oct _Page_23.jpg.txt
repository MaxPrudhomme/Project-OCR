t's 7:00 A.M. in Beverly Hills oldest, who bears a resemblance to
90210. In his comfortable, unos-
tentatious six-bedroom house,
Max Azria, founder of the ultra-
successful BCBG Max Azria line
($250 million in sales last year
from 80 stores worldwide), has been
awake for three hours and placed a
steady stream of calls to New York and
Paris. "For me, business is competition,"
he says, heavy on the French accent.
"It's sport. When you play a sport,
you've got to be the best." He closes the
Velcro straps on the Puma tennis shoes
he wears today with-you read this cor-
rectly white Prada pajamas. "It's about
comfort," he says of his look that sug-

age from 18 months (daughter Agnes) to

making his mark with the smart, contem-
porary sportswear looks of BCBG (which
stands for "bon chic, bon
genre," Parisian slang for
"good style, good atti-
tude"). "Some people start
at the high end of the mar-
ket and go lower. I started
low and worked up. I've
done everything contrary
to tradition."
