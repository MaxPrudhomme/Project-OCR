Your Place or MyHotel
If you're a feng shui freak who
can't leave home without a daily
dose of chi, the energy flow
balanced by the ancient Chinese
art of furniture placement, there's
a new hotel just for you. London's
MyHotel Bloomsbury, a 76-room
boutique hotel by Sir Terence
Conran's design team, has serene
interiors (arranged in accordance
with feng shui principles), in-room
spa treatments, a library with a juice
bar and MyChi, a restaurant with
an ultrahealthy, cross-cultural menu
that promises to "unify the body,
mind and soul." Heather Graham and
Michael Stipe have already checked
in, and it's been lan Schrager's
choice when staying in town to
oversee construction of his own
upcoming London hotels. Call 011-
44-171-667-6000 for reservations.
