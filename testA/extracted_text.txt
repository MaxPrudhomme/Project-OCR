First Person A Simple Man. When you are a smart
21st-century woman, you’re expected to date your
intellectual equal. But sometimes that doesn’t equal
love. Meghan Daum defends the irresistible allure of
cowboys, carpenters, and cops.

Etc. Shot in the Heart. Family man Skeet Ulrich is not
your typical Hollywood young gun.

Film Notes True Believers. In Holy Smoke! Kate
Winslet’s ecstasy matches Harvey Keitel’s agony. Plus:
The Cider House Rules, Ride With the Devil, and All
About My Mother. By Manohla Dargis.

Theater Shear Talent. Off-Broadway diva Claudia Shear
returns to center stage, but this time it’s not personal.
By Zoé Heller.

Music Beck Is Back. The baby-faced rock god becomes
a man with Midnite Vultures.

Books Magnificent Obsessions. Three modern

masters of photography offer bold new books. By
Katherine Dieckmann. Plus, Book Notes.

Media By Adriana Leshko and Anne E. Musumeci.
Broadcast Muse Perennial It Girl Diane Sawyer has
two major network jobs, a dazzling social calendar, and,
of course, that hair. Nancy Hass asks the question
that’s on everyone’s mind: Is she for real?

Party Politics From plus-ones to gate-crashers, everyone
in Hollywood obsesses about getting on the right guest
list. Deanna Kizis finds out who’s in with the In Crowd.

A Fiennes Affair Ralph Fiennes is famously dark

and brooding. In The End of the Affair he takes

his tortured image to new depths playing a

thwarted lover who can’t get what he wants.

Rob Tannenbaum talks to Hollywood’s Hamlet.
