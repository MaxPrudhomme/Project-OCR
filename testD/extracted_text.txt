The Combined
Maze

“A real story about real people,
people keenly and kindly seen, fearless-
ly and faithfully yet sympathetically
painted.”—N. Y. Times.

“Miss Sinclair makes her story alive
and her characters live. She has never
done this before. Artifice has now given
way to reality, and her novel now be-
comes a story of things as they are and
humanity as it is. The promise of
‘The Divine Fire’ and of ‘The Help-
mate’ is now fulfilled. At last Miss
Sinclair has found herself.”—Boston
Transcript.

Bobby ;

By ELEANOR ATKINSON

“Dear Mapam,—The account you
give of the association of the ‘Grand

Leddy’—by which term in its fullest ~

meaning you very perfectly denote the
late Baroness—with the historic little
dog is so charmingly written, and re-
vives so many memories which are dear
to me, that I cannot refrain from writing
to you on the subject. . . .

“T only wish she could have read it
all; and I am sure her eyes would have
moistened at your sympathetic biog-
raphy of the small but important per-
sonage on whom she lavished so much
affection, and subsequently no small
honor. She would have thanked you
from her heart for the book because it
gives, by an unusual and attractive
method; form and effect to the ethics
and sentiments which made her love
and protect animals.”—Mzr. Burpert-
Coerrs to Mrs. ATKINSON.

Desert
Gold

B:
ZANE GREY

Author of “Riders of the Purple Sage,” etc.

“But it is melodrama
pure and undefiled,” said
one reader of ‘Desert
Gold.” “What’s melo-
drama?” he was asked.
“A glorified dime novel
written with splendid distinction, with red vigor, but still
it is a sort of dime novel. There’s the same galloping
succession of events, the same tense situations, only it is
all presented with such delicacy, such literary charm, one
almost forgets the plot.”” That’s the story, after all.

The Judgment

House ,, «,,
GILBERT PARKER

“T have been reading with entire pleas-
ure and delight his new novel, ‘The Judg-
ment House.’”—CLEMENT SHORTER in
The London Sphere. :

“Brilliant and powerful, worthy*of its author’s proved
gifts. War and passion make it a legitimate melodrama.
Love and hate keep it impressively human.”—N. Y. World.

“A mighty good story, written with the cleverness of

construction and mastery of English that have made its

author famous.”—N. Y. American.

“Never has Sir-Gilbert written a novel more filled with
keen and poignant sense of life than is this story, woven
of London and the veld, of England and her policies,
South Africa and her struggles during the Boer War. . . .
It is a thrilling, majestically moving story.” —N. Y. Times.

The Wings of Pride

By LOUISE
KENNEDY
MABIE

The first time is always the
best. For then comes the
joy of discovery, the glow of
awakened sensation, the vivid
consciousness of exploring
new fields. Something of all
this we ask you toshare with
us in this new writer and her
new-born book. The old fa-
vorities we know—but did
we know them before they
were favorites and before
: they were old?

Here we see the very beginning, the very budding of
one. Her story—her story of young love’s awakening—is
as dewy fresh as the dawn, the tale of a natural story-teller
—the setting American and the plot enticing, charming,
delightful. Will you be among the first to acclaim her?

New Leaf. Mills

By WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS

“A good story, vivid and interesting
from beginning to end... . A penetrat-
ing psychological study, a faithful rec-
ord of intellectual and spiritual activity.
. -. An important historical document,
setting down ffor the information of
future generations the manners and
thoughts of the provincial Americans
who lived in the Middle West in the
days immediately after the Mexican
War.”—N. Y. Times.

“Whoever reads ‘New Leaf Mills’
leisurely will find that Mr. Howells’s
thetorical hand has lost none of its in-
comparable skill, and that he is still an
analyst of the human mind and a master
of English style.”—Boston Transcript.

“ One of Mr. Howells’s most readable
books, and forms an oasis in the desert
of popular, or rather of prevalent, fic-
tion.” —Pittsburgh Gazette-Times.

Matrimony  scrtox

_ This story is written “to the men and
girls who love each other more than
ease and show and sham.” It shows
in a happily convincing way that. it
requires brayery and endurance of a
different sort from that of the football

field to tackle matrimony on eighty

dollars a month—plenty on the man’s
part; still more on the woman’s.

The Dragoman

By GEORGE K. STILES

It is a love story. The heroine is an
American girl. The hero is a young
ishman. The scene is Egypt—
not the Egypt of hotels and tourists, but
the grim hinterland of the upper Nile,
where strange things happen and few
white men ever venture. The East
and its mystery, the inner workings of
international diplomacy, the mighty
power of Mohammedanism, are all
elements which make the story one of
i and fascinating interest.

The
Necessary Evil

By CHARLES RANN KENNEDY
AUTHOR OF “THE SERVANT IN THE HOUSE”

The play is ten times more stirring
than any novel or rhetorical ent.
Mr. Kennedy has the knack o' felting
the truth in a way that startles an
shocks, but never disgusts. This play
expresses just what the author thinks.
—what every one thinks in his heart—
about the social evil—and expresses it
with extraordinary directness, clean-
ness, and poetic elevation.
