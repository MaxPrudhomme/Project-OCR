is heading for Florida waters, or
give him one of Abercrombie’s
big boxes of all sorts of games to
play on the train. Or that folding
leather clock with a prayer that
its barometer and thermometer
consistently register high, with no
wavers. As to wavers: you know
those balls that waver in mid-air in
the shooting galleries? Well, you
can set one up in your own living-
room. Abercrombie will show you
how. The game is called the “Float-
ing Ball Target” and nicknamed
the “Annie Oakley.” It comes with
a hollow stand and a wire. You plug
the wire in the light socket, to make
air flow through the stand, which
makes the ball waver. Then you
get your gun and shoot, shoot, shoot.

TECLA
Big pearls,
pearls, rings.

round pearls, oval
Pendants, clip pins,
three-strand strings. Técla_ has
them all. And more besides. Técla
hasn’t only the pearls, they have
the ideas. They were first to put
the clasp of the necklace at the side.
First to launch chokers. First to
hang a single pear-shaped pearl at
the throat. Their newest idea is an
earring with interchangeable pen-
dants of either colored stones or cul-
ture pearls. With the green chiffon
you wear emeralds, with the pink
satin you wear pearls, with the black
net rubies. You simply clip the
pendants on the earring, and every-
one will think your jewel-case is
sparkling to the brim. A nice pres-
ent for the head of the family is one
of Técla’s handsome sets of studs,
because the cuff links in the picture
come with them. Ideal for your own
shirtwaist, too.

ATTENTION, KNITTERS!

Celeste Whitney knitted the sweater
on page 29 in a very soft white Ber-
nat yarn. Says she, “Having done
quite some skiing myself, I designed
this sweater in the best weight for
wear under the usual ski jacket and
with thought for the fact that after a
few minutes of skiing the jacket is
taken off and this sweater still re-
mains a warm enough protection.
I have simplified the directions as
much as possible.” Said directions
are clear, produce a good sweater
for both men and women, and can
be procured by writing to the Shop-
ping Bazaar, 572 Madison Avenue.

ADIOS!

When you receive an Alice Marks
steamer basket crammed with the
things you most enjoy, including a
package of life-savers and the Read-

ers Digest, ten to one it wasn’t the
thought and patience of your friend
that produced it. It was Alice
Marks. Clients go to her and say in
deep confidence, “Please send a ten-
dollar basket to so and so. She’s
the kind of girl who likes to discuss
politics.”” Miss Marks always knows
what to send. Her current best
seller is a wicker picnic basket with
two thermos bottles and service for
four. She got these baskets in
London where Asprey’s is selling
them by the hundred. But her most
remarkable find is American: a wal-
nut bucket lined with thermos. Fill
it with ice and attend—the ice does
not melt. One sceptic wouldn’t be-
lieve it so he left the bucket on his
desk a day and a night. The next
morning the ice was almost intact.
The photographer who took this pic-
ture reports the same miracle.

SOUP TO NUTS

Sherry on Park Avenue has opened
a delicatessen. You might persuade
your husband to stop by on the
maid’s' night out and bring. home
your supper. How about the to-
mato juice, the Virginia ham, or
chicken mousse, or an aspic of pig’s
feet, or snails all prepared and
ready to be popped in the oven?
The preserves include chestnuts in
chicken broth, spiced figs, apricot
honey spread, big black olives. The
delicatessen prices will startle you.
That pheasant is delivered, cooked
or ready to -be, complete with
feathers and a green cherry in his
mouth, for five dollars. All this
can be managed: by telephone. It’s
safer that way because the salads
and brioches and the largest wal-
nuts in the world are laid on trays
in the irresistible Sherry chocolate
manner. And don’t take the chil-
dren. This little scene took place
the day I was there. The mother,
“No. Certainly you can’t have a
cruller at this time of day.” The
child, “That’s all right, Mummie.
Tll take some of that, or that,
or that.” Situation. Temptation.
Fadeout with everyone munching.
